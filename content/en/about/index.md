### <u>Goal</u>
The final goal of our laboratory is to realize next generation intelligent information networks.

Toward the goal, we are researching new network architectures, network operations and management, intelligent processing algorithms, and advanced network applications from both aspects of software and hardware.

We aim to establish a network management system that delivers a large amount of information without degrading the quality, quickly, fairly, and securely regardless of wired systems such as optical broadband networks and wireless systems such as ad hoc and sensor networks.
